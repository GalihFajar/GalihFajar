### Well, Hello There ðŸ‘‹
Hi. I'm Galih. I currently am a senior year Telecommunication Engineering Student at Bandung Insitute of Technology. Even though Telecommunication doesn't sound like 'Computer Science', we do program a lot of things and I'm enjoying it. I started programming at my freshmen year at college, and have been fallen in love with it since then. 

### Web Development ðŸ•¸
Web development is what makes me can code (literally) every time, every day. What drives me into this field is actually because I was fascinated of how web programming can be done from scratch to production grade in relatively shorter time than other field (e.g. mobile development, game development, etc). 

### Machine Learning / Deep Learning ðŸ¤–
I also have an interest in Machine Learning, mainly because for the first time I saw it, it itches me to build a 'black magic' program that can calculate so complex things like a game of Chess, or even better, a game of Go.

### Combining Both... 
Combining both Machine Learning and Web Development is currently my 'coding goal' in the first half of 2021. In fact, for my final projects at college, my team and I is currently developing a system to detect violation in social distancing, built with Tensorflow for machine learning and Next.js + D3.js for the interface. I'm looking forward to publish it here!
